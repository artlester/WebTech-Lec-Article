            <p>Your web browser is a piece of software that you probably use nearly every day. In order to make the most of this tool, it’s important to know a bit about its history and understand how it works. Let’s take a brief look at the previous era of web browsers, explore today’s browser options and see what the future of web browsing might hold. </p>
           <p>Netscape had a strong start and remained the world’s most widely-used browser for quite some time, the release of Internet Explorer 4 was a game-changer for Microsoft. This version of the browser was integrated into Windows, which gave it a huge share of the desktop user market by default. At this time, many computer buyers had little experience using a web browser, so IE was all they knew</p>
            <p>A key component of any browser is its rendering engine, which is responsible for displaying the requested HTML and images on the browser screen. Rendering engines can display HTML, XML and images by default; with the help of extensions and plug-ins, they can also render data such as PDF documents</p>

            <p>Not all browsers use the same rendering engine. Firefox utilizes Gecko, and Safari uses a different engine called WebKit. Opera and Chrome use of Blink, which is based on WebKit. When a rendering engine is doing its work, it doesn’t make the user wait until it parses a whole document before displaying the contents of a web page.</p>
            <p>Firefox and Chrome are the top dogs in the era today. Internet Explorer has somewhat became unreliable. Will IE step up to keep contending with the top browsers of today? It is possible. Cloud-based browsers can also be a thing. Only time will tell how the improvements of all browsers will be developed. </p>
