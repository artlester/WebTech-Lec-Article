                    The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.</p>

                  <h1>World Wide Web (WWW)</h1>
        <p>WWW was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN. It was first named as Mesh and eventually renamed to World Wide Web when it was implemented in 1990. WWW is a collection of correlated resources that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for distributing and collaborating different data or information together that can be accessed via the internet.</p>

        <h1>Website</h1>
            <p>A website is based on the concept of "hypertext" and acts as a central location of various web pages that can be accessed with the use of a browser and it enables different pages to be published in the internet.</p></div>
            <pre><h3>HTML</h3> 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a language used to markup documents and create content  for the World Wide Web. Historically, HTML was used to specify structure and content of web pages, as well as presentations. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and includes cues appearance for of documents.
HISTORY
Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist and a contractor at CERN at the time, proposed a system for researchers at CERN to use and to share their documents. It was around 1990 when he specified HTML but was first named ‘HTML Tags’  when it was released.  HTML was based on another markup language which is the Standardized Generalized Markup Language(SGML).  Together with Dan Connolly, who worked with the SGML hypertext systems, they worked together to develop a Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) draft specification for HTML. 

<ul>HTML VERSIONS
<li>HTML 1.0
	-The first release of HMTL. This version has very limiting features.</li>
<li>HTML 2.0
	-This version was  published as IETF RFC 1866
	-Inherited every feature of the previous version but has some addition.</li>
<li>HTML 3.0
	-Dave Raggett who is a part of the HTML working group, introduced a draft for the HTML 3.0. This version has many  improvement features for webmaster designs. But this version was abandoned due to slow implementation of its improvements.</li>
<li>HTML 3.2
	- A version published by the W3C Recommendation and  was first named as WILBUR. It adopts Netscape visual mark up tags.</li>
<li>HTML 4.0
	-was also published as a W3C Recommendation. This version is characterized as strict, transitional, and most elements related to frames are allowed.</li>
<li>HTML 5
	-arose from effort to evolve HTML to address backward compatibility issues. This was initially by the WHATWG in 2004 with W3C signifying interest to participate. The first draft was published in 2008. HTML 5 incorporated specifications from the HTML4, XHTML, and the DOM ,and included various extensions of existing API and introduced new API as well.</li>
